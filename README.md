## Is what?

Simply put, RPMT answers the need of managing tabletop roleplaying campaigns; their story archs, locations, character- and other kind of datasheets. RMPT enables running campaigns remotely, so that campaign data is shared real time between Game Masters and Players.

#### Example cases

1. Game master needs to check Player Character awareness stat to solve if character can be aware of something happening in her surroundings.
2. Game Master needs to handle another Character (sheet) for the Player.
3. Player need to update his character sheet in-combat or between quests (consuming experience points).
